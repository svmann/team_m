The program reads the list of Pokemon from a json file and stores it into a linked list. The user is then prompted to enter 1 to find a Pokemon by its Pokedex number or 2 to find the pokemon by name. The program then displays the Pokemon’s Pokedex number, Pokemon’s name, their type, and any evolutions if they have any. 
The program utilizes a class named Pokedex that has a method called run. The run method opens the json file called pokedex.json as read only and then parses the json data into an object called pokemon that contains the data ‘id’, ‘name’, ‘types’, and ‘evolves_into. It then prints the menu to the screen to ask the user how it would like to search for a Pokemon whether it be by its Pokedex number or name of the Pokemon. If the value entered is not on the menu it tells the user to enter a valid number and reprints the menu. After a selection is made it prompts the user to enter either an ID or name and searches for that specific entry then outputs the proper Pokemon’s Pokedex number, name, type, and evolutions. If the selection for ID is out of range it informs the user of how many pokemon objects are currently stored in the linked list and goes back to the first menu. If the name entered is not found it informs the user that the name is not found in the linked list and goes back to the first menu.
